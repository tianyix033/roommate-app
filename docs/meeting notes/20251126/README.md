Dear all,
At 20:15 on Nov.26th, our team held a meeting on Google Meet as planned. Participants included Drastansh, Eric, Moayad, Steven, Terry, and Tianyi.

In this meeting, we discussed our progress on the project. We decided to continue to review, merge (or potentially update) the PRs we already have, and once we have all the features thoroughly implemented (BDD and TDD included), try to test in a real browser to see how well our application works. We discussed the possibility of incorporating SSO using omniAuth. We also discussed deployment issues deploying on heroku.

Sincerely,
Tianyi Xu

-----
Tasks: complete BDD and TDD for all features, and test in a real browser to see how well our application works.
