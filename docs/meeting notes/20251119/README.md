Dear all,

In class time on Nov. 19th, our team held a meeting and discussed the state of our project. Participants included Eric, Kevin, Moayad, Tianyi, and Terry.

In the meeting, we set the goal of passing all TDD and BDD tests of our respective branches, create pull requests, and have them reviewed and merged by next Wednesday. After which point we will see how our application pieces together and actually runs in a browser and then decide our next steps.

Specifically, the professor mentions the number of branches created and merged as a KPI for us, so we should be working on more branches, within reasonable conditions.

Please feel free to add or correct any information.

Sincerely,Tianyi Xu
