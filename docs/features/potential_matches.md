# Potential Matches Feature

## User Story

**As a** Member  
**I want to** view potential roommate matches  
**So that** I can find compatible roommates to share housing costs

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Happy Path**: When I visit the matches page, I should see a list of potential roommate matches with their basic information and compatibility scores.

2. **Edge Case**: When there are no potential matches available, I should see a message indicating "No matches found" with suggestions to update my profile preferences.

3. **Failure Case**: When I try to access the matches page without being logged in, I should be redirected to the login page.

4. **Match Details**: When I click on a potential match, I should see detailed information including their profile, lifestyle preferences, and compatibility score.

5. **Like/Save Match**: When I like a potential match, it should be saved to my favorites and I should see a confirmation message.
