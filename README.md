RoomMate ([Room-Mate.app](https://Room-Mate.app/)) is a SaaS platform that helps students and newcomers find compatible roommates and share housing costs.

- Build secure user profiles with lifestyle, budget, and housing preferences
- Match seekers and listers with a compatibility engine and verified listings
- Coordinate through messaging while persisting preferences, history, and matches

## Key Features
- Search active listings by city, price band, and free-text keywords
- Flag listings for community verification and surface a “Verified” badge once approved
- Maintain listing state via statuses (`pending`, `published`, `Verified`) so staff can gate what members see

Detailed requirements live in [Project_Specification](docs/Project_Specification.md).

## Stack
- Language: Ruby 3.3.8, HTML, CSS
- Framework: Ruby on Rails 7
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Testing:
  - Unit & request: RSpec
  - System/acceptance: Cucumber, Capybara (search + listing verification flows today)

## Getting Started
```bash
# ensure your shell loads rbenv shims
eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"   # or "- bash" for Bash users

rbenv install 3.3.8       # once per machine
rbenv local 3.3.8         # ensures this version for the repo
bundle install
bin/rails db:prepare
bin/rails server
```

Use `bin/rails db:prepare` for day-to-day work; run `bundle exec rails db:setup` on a fresh machine to create, migrate, and seed everything in one shot. The seeds create listings with valid statuses and owner emails so the verification UI has data to demonstrate.

## Testing
- Unit/request suite: `bundle exec rspec`
- Acceptance flows (search + verification): `bundle exec cucumber`
  - By default, `cucumber.yml` limits runs to `features/search_listings.feature` and `features/verify_listings.feature`
  - To run the focused profile explicitly (CI equivalent): `bundle exec cucumber features/search_listings.feature features/verify_listings.feature`
  - Provide paths for any additional `.feature` files you add later.
